        to feed them food that is formulated for puppies, 
        it contains nutrients needed for them to develop.  
When bringing a puppy home, they should be fed 3 â€“ 4 times per day. 
If their food is substituted with another food, this transition 
should take place gradually, over a period of several days, 
in order to avoid any digestive problems.
To train your pet to meal feed as a puppy, they should be 
fed at the same times every day as this creates a sense of security for the puppy. At about six months of age, you can cut feedings back to three times a day, and then cut back to twice or once a day." /></Link>
