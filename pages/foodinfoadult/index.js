Most large breed dogs will weigh between 50 to 150 pounds, while small breeds weigh under 20 pounds. Small dogs have higher energy requirements than large dogs and need a dense, nutrient-rich food. Adult dogs mostly only require two meals a day. Sticking to a schedule can help your canine companion avoid grazing, feel like part of the family, and can encourage good mealtime behavior." />
